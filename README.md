# The-Gaming-Room
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 
*The client was The Gaming Room, they wanted a web-based game created that would service multiple platforms based on the game Draw It or Lose It. Software requirements are (1) A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved. (2) Each team will have multiple players assigned to it. (3) Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name. (4) Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
*I think I did well meeting the clients intent, especially with breaking down the differences of the different operating systems in the evaluations section. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? 
*The domain model diagram made reviewing the code easier to understand and grasp where my potiental code issues were. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 
*I don't think I would revise anything other than doing anything proof read to ensure I corrected any grammar mistakes. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 
*The user's needs are a focal point for that guides how we are to do the work that was requested. Based on what they wanted as the main outcome allows for flexibility to provide options that would meet the criteria based on pros and cons of each approach that could be taken. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? 
*The first approach was first read what was needed from the client. Afterwards I compared the UML Diagram with the code to ensure all of the classes, attributes, etc matched. For future applications I would go about the same way by creating the UML diagram then creating the code and any changes that would need to be made, would be on the UML diagram first before editing my code.
